<!-- external css -->
<!-- we can just change a style by changing into one file only i.e .css file -->
<!-- that .css file should not conatain any html element -->
<!-- CSS file is connected to html file by link int <head> with rel and href -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Web page</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>this is an external CSS</h1>
    </body>
</html>



<!-- internal css -->
<!-- styling of element is performed inside the <style> tag which is inside the <head> -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            p{color: red;}
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>this is internal css</p>
    </body>
</html>


<!-- inline css -->
<!-- styling is performed in the tag of the element -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    <body>
        <p style="color: red;">this is inline css</p>
    </body>
</html>


<!-- IMPORTANT POINTS -->
<!-- if internal css is before the link of the external css then the external css will override internal-->
<!-- if internal css is after the link of the external css then the internal css will override external -->
<!-- inline css has higher priority.It overrides the external and internal css if all three 
    are present in the code. -->
